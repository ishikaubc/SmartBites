###Inspiration
The idea for SmartBites stems from a need to combine convenience and technology to promote mindful eating habits. With increasing reliance on digital tools, we wanted to build an app that not only simplifies meal tracking but also rewards users for smart choices. Inspired by the popularity of gamification in apps, we sought to create a system that combines receipt scanning, instant rewards, and user-friendly meal management to encourage healthier lifestyles.

###What It Does
SmartBites is an innovative platform that:

Scans receipts: Users can scan receipts from grocery or restaurant purchases.
Rewards users: Based on purchase data, users earn points that can be redeemed for discounts or other incentives.
Tracks spending: Provides insights into meal expenses, helping users make informed financial decisions.
Promotes smart eating habits: Encourages users to make healthier choices by rewarding them for nutritious food purchases.

###How We Built It
Frontend:
Developed using React Native for a cross-platform mobile experience.
Used Expo's ImagePicker and Camera API for receipt scanning and barcode reading.
Integrated a seamless UI with real-time feedback mechanisms for user interactions.
Backend:
Built with FastAPI to handle receipt processing and point calculations.
Integrated Python scripts to validate and analyze receipt data using third-party APIs.
Database management using PostgreSQL to store user data, receipt histories, and reward points.
Technologies Used:
Python for backend logic and API integrations.
JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend development.
PostgreSQL for robust data handling.

###Challenges We Ran Into
Receipt Parsing:
Processing receipt images from various formats and ensuring accurate data extraction was a technical challenge.
Camera Integration:
Ensuring smooth camera operations across different devices required testing and debugging.
API Errors:
Handling inconsistencies in third-party APIs during receipt processing caused delays in implementation.
Cross-Platform Testing:
Addressing platform-specific issues for iOS and Android, especially for media handling.
User Experience:
Designing a clean, intuitive interface that balances simplicity with functionality.
