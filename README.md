   Idea 1: Gamify Sustainable Purchase

 
 Objective: To help students choose sustainable meals by giving them incentive and rewards. The more smart meals they buy, the more points they collect. These points can be redeemed in coupons to be able to make free/discounted meal purchases.


Tech Stack - React Native, Firebase, OpenCV(for image processing), Machine learning for training the model.

Impact - Compare the number of smart meals purchased initially vs after the point system has been implemented. 

Point system - for every meal purchased for $5, the user gets 10 points. For 100 points, user can redeem that for the selected number of points
